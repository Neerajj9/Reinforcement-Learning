# Reinforcement-Learning
A simple demonstration of reinforcement learning using CNN to play the Cartpole game (Atari).

In this project , reinforcement learning is implemented wherein the A.i. bot (Neural Network Model ) made the decision regarding the next move 
depending upon the information of the current game scenario it got from the previous move . The model was initially trained on random moves and then 
trained on calculated moves .
